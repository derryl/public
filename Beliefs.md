###Personal Fulfillment

- Creating original stuff is important (whatever your profession happens to be).
- It's important to be around people with whom you share at least some core beliefs.
- Make a point of doing things that you consider new and "unlike you".



###Law

- Laws are the fabric that allow people (and businesses)to co-exist peacefully.
- In any given situation: certain rules do not apply.
- The decision to take drugs should be made by individuals, not legally-mandated.
- That said, many drugs represent *bad* decisions.

###Human Nature (Biological)

- Regardless of our so-called ability to reason, we are strongly influenced by behavorial heuristics that developed millions of years ago.
- Humans have a far easier time *conceiving* of a rational and peaceful society than we do *implementing* it.
- Humans were not built for the world in which we live today (full of people whom we do not know personally).

###Human Nature (Non-Biological)

- Humans are innately good. By this, I mean we usually do things that our belief systems indicate as being desirable.
